			<h2 class = "text-left title"> Chuwei, March 2016</h2>
			<p class = "text-left"> I have been teaching children for years and found out many of my students' parents have troubles teaching their children at home. </p>
			<p> These are the things I have heard from the parents:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> "My kid cannot stay focused." </li>
				<li> "He just wouldn't listen to me." </li>
				<li> "This is the fourth time I teach XXX, but she still cannot get it." </li>
				<li> "I don't know how to teach my kid. It's always a battle." </li>
			</ul>			
			<p> A good lesson plan would greatly reduce the time and effort on your part, and helps your children retain information much longer.  An effective lesson plan has five steps: Hook, Teach, Practice, Accessment, Closure.</p>
